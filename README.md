1.	Summarize the project and what problem it was solving: A concise summary of the project should describe what the project does and what problem it solves. This can include details about the technology used, the target audience, and the key features.
2.	What did you do particularly well? When answering this question, it is important, to be honest, and reflect on your own strengths and weaknesses. Some areas to highlight could be the quality of the code, the efficiency of the solution, the creativity and innovation of the approach, or the ability to collaborate with others. Worked well with my tutors, looking for grammar errors, misplaced characters, spacing, and the file path, finding bugs, and fixing them. Creating a new C++ project, add .cpp file, add text file. 
3.	Where could you enhance your code? In this question, you should identify areas where your code could be improved and discuss the potential benefits of these improvements. This could include making the code more efficient, secure, or user-friendly, or adding new features that would make it more useful. Practice, variables, strings, functionality, map, arrays, frequencies, loops, C++, Python, Java, Eclipse, and Visual Studios, getting comfortable with writing my own code, I will start making my own projects based on what I learned to get a better grasp of the concepts. 
4.	Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? When discussing the most challenging pieces of code, it is important to be specific about what was difficult and how you overcame those difficulties. This could include seeking help from others, researching solutions online, or experimenting with different approaches until finding one that worked. Learning C++, strings, and running the code, the program kept disconnecting, logging me out, re-logging, and correcting the code, the file path is what was aggravating, and challenging, but it was something I need to work on. I know how to create a new C++ project, pick the correct computer language, open, close, exit the program, create a zip file, and upload, and download the correct file, which I am doing very well. I just need to practice and learn things on my own, create my own little projects, and use w3school to practice C++, I want to be able to make my code and format different colors, and use my artistic creative skills. 
5.	What tools or resources are you adding to your support network? This question is an opportunity to discuss any tools or resources that you have found helpful in your work, and to describe how you plan to continue expanding your support network in the future. This could include attending workshops, following blogs and forums, or seeking advice from colleagues and mentors. I use ChatGPT, YouTube, Google, and my SNHU Tutors. 
6.	What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to coursework or course work? In this question, you should reflect on what skills you have developed or honed through your work on this project, and how these skills will be valuable in future work or coursework. This could include technical skills such as programming or data analysis, or non-technical skills such as problem-solving, teamwork, or communication. Creating websites, and mobile apps, adding to my portfolio and getting a job at Intel, Dell, and HP.
7.	How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable? In this question, you should discuss the steps you took to ensure that your code is easy to understand, modify, and maintain over time. This could include writing clear and concise documentation, using descriptive variable names, breaking the code into smaller, modular components, or using version control software to track changes to the code.
